Example: Fraud Schema for a "Phishing Scam Cluster"

Entities (Nodes):

1. Users (User A, User B, User C)


2. Scam Email Domains (e.g., fakebank.com, secure-login.net)


3. Scam Phone Numbers (e.g., +1234567890)


4. Fraudulent Transactions (Transaction X, Transaction Y)


5. High-Risk Merchants (Fake Investment Site, Suspicious E-Commerce)



Relationships (Edges):

User A received a phishing email from fakebank.com.

User A also got a scam call from +1234567890.

User A attempted a high-value transaction at a flagged merchant.

User B also received the same phishing email and later reported unauthorized transactions.

User C interacted with a scam call and tried to withdraw money from an offshore account.

How Neuro-Symbolic AI Uses This Graph-Based Schema

1. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) detect hidden fraud patterns

The AI system analyzes how fraud spreads within the network.

It detects users who are at high risk based on their connections to known fraud patterns.



2. Symbolic AI generates explainable fraud alert rules

Example Rule:
“If a user receives a phishing email and later attempts a high-value transaction at a flagged merchant, trigger additional authentication.”

This rule is distributed via the blockchain to financial entities.
